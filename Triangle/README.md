# Essential Things

1. **Install GLFW and OpenGL:**
   - Ensure that you have installed the `glfw` library and OpenGL.
   - You can install them using pip:
     ```
     pip install glfw
     pip install pyopengl
     ```

2. **Import Necessary Libraries:**
   - Before starting your coding session, make sure to import the required libraries:
     ```python
     import glfw
     from OpenGL.GL import *
     ```

By following these steps, you'll have the necessary libraries installed and imported, ready to start coding with GLFW and OpenGL.
